### Appeal process

If you feel one of your solutions will work but was marked off, you can do the following:

1. Take a picture of the question and solution.

2. Accept the [midterm-appeal assignment](https://classroom.github.com/a/Slqqlqmk).

3. Test if the solution works.

4. If it does, add a markdown cell with the original picture and commit/push the example.

5. Provide a Slack message to Jason Kuruzovich and Lianlian Jiang with a link to the repository.

Your solution must work 100%. You cannot use this method to request additional partial credit.
